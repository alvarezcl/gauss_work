First off,

Git clone …

Open INSTALL.md to read installation instructions.

Check dependencies:
Numpy
Astropy
PyYAML
PyAST WCS pkg – Download .tar and run: python setup.py install
Astropy WCS (Scipy Dependency)

Scons – sudo apt-get install scons (2.0 or 2.1)

FFTW(3) for version 3 or above. 
Download .tar, cd into extracted file, run :
sudo ./configure
sudo make 
sudo make install

TMV
http://code.google.com/p/tmv-cpp/
Download .tar, unpack
then run:
sudo scons install
(Takes a while)

BOOST
Download boost, unpack .tar
run:
./bootstrap.sh –with-python=<pythonDirectory> (To ensure Boost runs with appropriate version )

Now go back to GalSim Dir:
scons
or
scons -options for linking EXTRA_INCLUDE_PATH, TMV_DIR, BOOST_DIR

(Had to go back and recompile TMV with PREFIX, WITH_OPENMP=False)


  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

---- MG attempt

cloned Galsim
  - already had FFTW from before

installed scons  (using apt-get)

installed tmv (downloaded 0.72 version from Mike's page, unzipped, and installed by hand using all defaults)
  -  scons install (quite long)
  -  scons test  (long process, all checks out fine in the end)

installed boost (got it off USB stick from Luis, unzipped, and installed by hand using all defaults)
  - 	./bootstrap.sh
  - 	sudo ./b2 link=shared
  - 	sudo ./b2 link=shared install

installed python-nose (using apt-get)
  - found name of needed pkg by looking at output of  apt-cache search nosetests
  
Finally: go back into Galsim
  - scons install
  - scons tests


Then look at examples -- they look quite fine. :-)
